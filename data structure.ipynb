That is, it will be stored in the way we input it. Therefore, Lists are ordered sequences. List in Python also offers various simple and shorthand ways like List comprehensions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hashing Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python dictionaries use a hash table to store and retrieve values quickly. The key’s hash value determines where it is stored in the memory.\n",
    "Immutable objects, like strings, numbers, and tuples (containing only immutable elements), have a consistent hash value throughout their lifetime. If keys were mutable, their hash values could change, leading to data being lost or making it impossible to retrieve.\n",
    "Consistency and Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "If dictionary keys were mutable, modifying a key would affect the data structure. It would make retrieving the associated value unreliable since the original hash value, and thus the key’s position in the hash table, would no longer be correct.\n",
    "For example, if a list were used as a key, and the list’s contents were altered, the dictionary would no longer be able to find the associated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "The immutability of keys ensures that the dictionary operations (insertion, deletion, and lookup) remain efficient. Mutable keys could degrade performance, as the dictionary would need to account for possible changes in keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing immutability prevents common errors. For instance, if a key were mutable, a slight modification to it might result in a different key, leading to a new entry being created or a failure to retrieve the original entry. This could introduce hard-to-debug issues in programs."
